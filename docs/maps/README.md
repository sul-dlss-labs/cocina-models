# COCINA Metadata Application Profiles (MAPs) üó∫Ô∏è

This directory contains the metadata application profiles, or MAPs, for resources managed within the Stanford Digital Repository.

Ultimately, these will relate to the API specifications for resources passed in or out for resource metadata validation and management. These are also MAPs we expect to iterate on, given the nature of metadata in library digital repository systems.

Fuller documentation on these MAPs and the underlying model can be found here: https://sul-dlss.github.io/taco-truck/COCINA.html#cocina-data-models--shapes
